# Block Hider Plugin

## A basic plugin for hiding blocks from the Block Selector in WordPress

**Author:** Bret Farley 

The purpose of this plugin is to allow a WordPress Administrator to select which blocks they wish to show in the Block Inserter, across every site in the network. Two sets of checkboxes will control this: one from the list of parent blocks loaded in PHP, and the other from the list of variation blocks generated in JavaScript once the Edit View loads.
